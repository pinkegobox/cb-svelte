# CommerceBear Svelte

View the project <a href="https://commerce-bear-svelte.vercel.app/">here</a>.

Svelte toy project where I re-created the landing page of <a href="http://commercebear.com/">CommerceBear</a> in order to compare and contrast the differences between popular JavaScript component frameworks React and Svelte.

## Features
- Tech and concepts used: 
    * Modern ES6
    * Bootstrapped with sveltejs/template
    * HTML5 and modern CSS3 properties (Flexbox, CSS Grids)

## To Do

(Improvements I would like to make if I had more time)

- Replace class components with function components using React Hooks
- Add CSS animations and style hover states to mirror the look of the main page more accurately

## Get started

Clone the repository and ensure the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your machine.
 
Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.
