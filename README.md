# CommerceBear Svelte

View the project <a href="https://commerce-bear-svelte.vercel.app/">here</a>.

Svelte toy project where I re-created the landing page of <a href="http://commercebear.com/">CommerceBear</a> in order to compare and contrast the differences between popular JavaScript component frameworks React and Svelte.

## Features
- Tech and concepts used: 
    * Modern ES6
    * Bootstrapped with sveltejs/template
    * HTML5 and modern CSS3 properties (Flexbox, CSS Grids)

## Get started

Clone the repository and ensure the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is installed on your machine.
 
Go to the project directory and install the dependencies...

```bash
cd NAME-OF-PROJECT
npm install
```

To start the development server...

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and you should see the app running.

## To Do

(Improvements I would like to make if I had more time)

- Responsive design to make the page suitable for every screen width & device
- Add CSS animations and style hover states to mirror the look of the main page more accurately
